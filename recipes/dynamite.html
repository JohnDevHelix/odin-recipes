    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Dynamite Lumpia is a version of the popular Filipino deep-fried egg rolls. This version is unique because it involves the use of stuffed long green chili. The idea is somewhat similar to chile relleno, except that the stuffed chili peppers are wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep fried until golden brown and crispy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 pieces long green pepper</li>
        <li>4 ounces cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 pieces lumpia wrapper</li>

        <li>6 ounces ground pork</li>
        <li>1 pience onion (minced)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (crushed and minced)</li>
        <li>1 piece egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ground pork stuffing by heating 3 tablespoons oil in a pan. Saute garlic and onion until the latter softens. Add ground pork. Saute until medium brown.

        <li>Slice one side of the peppers lengthwise all the way to the bottom. Remove the seeds by gently scraping using a small spoon or a butter knife. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Heat 2 cups of oil in a pan. Fry each piece of dynamite lumpia in medium heat for 2 minutes per side or until lumpia wrapper turns golden brown. Note: you may fry longer if needed.</li>
